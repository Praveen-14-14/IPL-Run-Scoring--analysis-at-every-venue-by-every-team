Started with an uncleaned CSV file containing IPL match data. Used PySpark in Google Colab to clean the dataset by handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies. After preprocessing, uploaded the cleaned data into Power BI for visualization and analysis. Generated insights on first innings average scores of all IPL teams across different venues. Finally, exported the analyzed data and visualizations, creating a new CSV file and an image for further use.
